# Intro to 3D Printing

**Authors**: Heather Gibling

## Preface: ##

This is an intro to 3D printing and creating things to print with Tinkercad.

A [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) account is required to make things, and software for a 3D printer is required to submit an object. We are using the Makerbot Replicator 2 printer, so [Makerbot Print](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/download/) sofware should be downloaded (specifically, the **Legacy Printer Support** version at the very bottom of the page).

## Lesson Overview: ##

We start with a demonstration of how 3D printers work and what they are capable of. We will find a pre-made object on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) to print, learn what files to download and how to import them into Makerbot Print.

Then we will learn how to modify the object in Makerbot Print, check how long it will take to print, and see if it needs support structures to print properly. We will submit the object to our printer and get it started!

Finally we will explore making our own objects in Tinkercad. We will learn how to interact with objects, modify them, combine objects, download files to use in Makerbot Print, and more!

## Dependencies: ##

* Access to a 3D printer. We will be using a Makerbot Replicator 2, but this lesson should be able to be modified for use with any 3D printer
* Software for the 3D printer. We will be using Makerbot Print, but use the software that corresponds to the 3D printer being used. (Note that file extensions might be different depending on your printer)
* A Tinkercad account
