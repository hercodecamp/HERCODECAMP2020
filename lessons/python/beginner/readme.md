# Introduction to Python #

**Authors**: Heather Gibling, Marta Skreta, Mariana D'Angelo, Swapna Seshadri

## Preface: ##

We created introduction to python workshops suited for beginner programmers. A free, open-source, coding camp for high school students who identify as a girl, trans, or non-binary.

We developed our Intro to Python workshop based on material from [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), [Let's Learn Python](http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/), and [The Coding Hive](https://www.thecodinghive.com/).

## Lesson Overview: ##

* syntax
* functions
* variables
* data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
* number and string manipulation
* lists
* logic (conditional statements, loops)

We end in a project building a rock, paper, scissors game applying concepts learned in this lesson.

## Dependencies: ##

We will be using Python3 with jupyter notebooks.
